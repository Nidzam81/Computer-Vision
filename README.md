This repository is a collection of python code used in my computer vision projects (mostly code used for inference). 
I did not include the training code since it is pretty straight forward using tensorflows libraries. 
You just need to get the picture labelled and put it into the training and validation folders.  
However, I do take a lots of effort in collecting and labelling the data which is taking most of my time.
